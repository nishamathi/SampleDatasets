# SampleDatasets

This repository consists of various sample datasets that I have used in my Google Colab notebooks.

--------------------
### *blue-jays.csv*

*Description:* Body measurements for a sample of blue jays

*Format:* A dataset with 123 observations on the following 9 variables.

Variable | Description
------------ | -------------
BirdID	  |        ID tag for bird
KnownSex	 |       Sex coded as F or M
BillDepth	 |       Thickness of the bill measured at the nostril (in mm)
BillWidth	 |       Width of the bill (in mm)
BillLength	 |     Length of the bill (in mm)
Head	      |      Distance from tip of bill to back of head (in mm)
Mass	     |       Body mass (in grams)
Skull	    |        Distance from base of bill to hack of skull (in mm)
Sex	      |        Sex coded as 0=female or 1=male

*Details:* Body measurements for captured blue jays. Values are averaged for birds captured more than once.

*Predicted attribute:* Usually is the sex of bird.

*Source:* Data from Keith Tarvin, Department of Biology, Oberlin College

### *MyIris.csv*

*Description:* This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature. Fisher's paper is a classic in the field and is referenced frequently to this day. (See Duda & Hart, for example.) The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.

*Format:* A dataset with 150 observations on the following 5 variables.

*Note:* This data differs from the data presented in Fishers article (identified by Steve Chadwick, spchadwick '@' espeedaz.net ). 

*Attribute Information:*
Variable | Description
------------ | -------------
sepal.length | sepal length in cm
sepal.width | sepal width in cm
petal.length | petal length in cm
petal.width | petal width in cm
variety | class: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolour, and Iris Virginica

*Predicted attribute:* Usually is the class of iris plant.
